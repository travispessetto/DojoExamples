# Dojo Toolkit examples

These are my examples of Dojo toolkit features.  I have tried to keep them
simple for my sake, if I need to review something, and anyone else's sake.
Some of them use Google's CDN while other have the Dojo toolkit directly avalible.

## Examples

While there are many folders here and each one corresponds to an example not
all are functional because I determined they are not worth my time right now.
Therefore here is a list of the functional examples.

* animation
* customModule
* datagrid
* store

## Requirements

There is not much of a requirement to run these examples except use of a
webserver.

## Website

Since I figure viewing examples online would be a good idea. There is an index.html
file at the base of this repository that provides a simple way to view all of
the working files.  I plan on using this as the same code that is in the repository
on the website.  I guess my point is there is no Dojo code to look at in that file.
